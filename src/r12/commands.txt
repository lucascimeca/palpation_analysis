**********************************************************************************


START                                           initializes arm and variables
CALIBRATE                                       calibrate arm   
HOME                                            go to home position
WHERE                                           tells joint positions
CARTWHERE                                       gives cartesian coordinates
DE-ENERGIZE                                     enter it to move the robot by hand
ENERGIZE                                        energizes it (can't move by hand)
TELL *JOINT* *NUM* [MOVE/MOVETO/REVERSE]        MOVE is relative motion of *NUM*
                                                MOVETO is absolute motion (get to *NUM* position)
                                                REVERSE is reverse relative motion of *NUM*
                                                *JOINT* can be one of [WAIST/SHOULDER/ELBOW/L-HAND/WRIST] 
GRIP/UNGRIP                                     operate electric gripper
GRIPPER ON/GRIPPER OFF                          operate pneumatic gripper
*NUM* [SPEED/ROLLSPEED/TRACKSPEED/ACCEL] !      stores *NUM* in variable SPEED(etc.) (default value is 5000) 
                                                - *NUM* can be NORMAL
SETTINGS                                        shows current speed and acceleration 
ALIGN/NONALIGN                                  align with the x axis


** definitions! **

: FAST 30000 SPEED ! 2000 ACCEL ! ;
: SLOW 2000 SPEED ! 1000 ACCEL ! ;
then can do e.g. FAST SPEED



** cartesian mode **

CARTESIAN                                       sets the robot in cartesian mode
WHERE                                           gives the xyz positions of the robot
0 1000 0 MOVE (a relative command)              The robot will move forwards on the Y axis a further 100.0 mm. 
                                                (remember 1000 is 1000 times 0.1mm units). 
                                                (actually you can enter 100.0 – it makes no difference but 
                                                looks better. Just 100 on its own would be 10.0 mm not 100mm)
*X* *Y* *Z* MOVETO                              absolute xyz
JOINT TELL SHOULDER 1000 MOVE                   tells joint to move, but needs to recalibrate!!
                                                COMPUTE CARTWHERE
                                                
                                                         

** examples **

TELL WAIST 1000 MOVE (press enter) (small delay then) OK
The robot moves 1000 steps and when it stops you see OK. Try
WHERE
 WAIST SHOULDER ELBOW L-HAND WRIST OBJECT
 1000 0 0 0 0
1000 MOVE
We are still talking to the waist so it moves another 1000
WHERE
 WAIST SHOULDER ELBOW L-HAND WRIST OBJECT
 2000 0 0 0 0
Another 1000 brings the total movement to 2000
1500 MOVETO
MOVE was a relative command and MOVETO is an absolute command.
Now the waist moves back from 2000 to 1500
WHERE
 WAIST SHOULDER ELBOW L-HAND WRIST OBJECT
 1500 0 0 0 0
-1000 MOVE
Now the waist moves backwards 1000
WHERE
 WAIST SHOULDER ELBOW L-HAND WRIST OBJECT
 500 0 0 0 0
TELL SHOULDER REVERSE 1000 MOVE
Now the shoulder will move backwards
WHERE
 WAIST SHOULDER ELBOW L-HAND WRIST OBJECT
 500 -1000 0 0 0
And so on for the other axes.
You can move any axis with the word STEPS e.g.
TELL WAIST 1000 STEPS
However these will not be counted so when you type WHERE they do not show.


** cartesian examples **

WHERE
 X Y Z PITCH W OBJECT
 0 0 750.0 -90.0 0 (for R17)
 0 0 500.0 -90.0 0 (for R12)
The position referred to is the intersection of the hand pitch and hand roll (W) axes.
The place where X Y and Z are all zero (the origin) is at the intersection of the shoulder axes
and the axis of rotation of the waist. This is clearly not at bench level. The distance between
these two positions when the arm is dead straight (as it is in the HOME position) is 500mm
for an R12 and 750mm for an R17.
A PITCH value of –90.0 degrees is with the hand pointing up. 0 degrees is horizontal and
90.0 degrees is pointing down.
Important: RoboForth is an integer system. There are no decimal places. 500mm is
expressed in RoboForth as 5000 i.e. 5000 units of 0.1mm each. 90 degrees is expressed as
900 i.e. 900 units of 0.1 degrees.
